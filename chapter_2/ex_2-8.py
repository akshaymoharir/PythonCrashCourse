## Python Crash Course

# Exercise 2.8: Number Eight: 
#               Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. 
#               Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
#               print(5 + 3)
#               Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.
