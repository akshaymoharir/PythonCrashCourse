# Exercise 3.4: Guest List:  
#               If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? 
#               Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner . 
#               Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner .

def main():
    
    # Prepare empty list for invitees 
    dinnerInvitees = []

    # Add invitees one by one in the invitees list
    dinnerInvitees.append('Andrew Ng')
    dinnerInvitees.append('Narendra Modi')
    dinnerInvitees.append('Jordon')
   
   # Send invitation to invitees
    for i in range(len(dinnerInvitees)):
        
        # Generic greeting message
        greetingMessage = "Hi " +  str(dinnerInvitees[i]) + ", it's my birthday today, would you join us for the dinner? " \
                            "\nWe also have following guests joining us: "
