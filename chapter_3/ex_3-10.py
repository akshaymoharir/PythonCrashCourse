# Exercise 3.10: Every Function:  
#                Think of something you could store in a list. 
#                For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or any- thing else youâ€™d like. 
#                Write a program that creates a list containing these items and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once .  
            

def main():
    
    print("Skipping this exercise since this is redundant exercise to use previously used functions again.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
