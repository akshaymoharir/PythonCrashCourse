# Exercise 6.8: Pets:  
#               Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a pet. 
#               In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. 
#               Next, loop through your list and as you do print everything you know about each pet.
